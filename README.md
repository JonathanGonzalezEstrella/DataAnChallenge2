Data Analytics Boot Camp Challenge 2
Excel VBA Stock Performance Analyzer

This VBA script is designed for analyzing stock data across multiple sheets within an Excel workbook named "Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx". It calculates the yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume for each ticker.

Yearly Change: Difference between the closing price at the end of the year and the opening price at the beginning of the year.
Percent Change: Yearly change expressed as a percentage.
Total Stock Volume: Sum of traded volume throughout the year.
The script also identifies and highlights:

The ticker with the Greatest % Increase in green.
The ticker with the Greatest % Decrease in red.
The ticker with the Greatest Total Volume.
Conditional formatting is applied to the "Yearly Change" column to visually distinguish positive changes (green) from negative changes (red).
